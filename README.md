These are games and programs I've written/ported to MMBasic and optimized for the PicoCalc handheld device. See notes below for details for each game/program.

## games
[drugwars.bas](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/roge-rm/picobasic/refs/heads/main/drugwars.bas) - port of the TI Basic version of the classic game Drug Wars, a game I played a lot of on my TI-83 in high school. The game has been mostly rewritten as part of the port but I tried to keep the tone/attitude of the source material as I find it nostalgic.
